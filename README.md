Team Winnovation - SmartFile BakeOff 2013

## Preamble
- This project was created by Eric Lovelace and Levi Miller (collectively known as Team Winnovation) for entry into the 2013 SmartFile Bakeoff. A competition designed to encourage the use and creation of open source projects and the SmartFile api.  Find more details about the project at: http://www.smartfile.com/bakeoff/

- We have built on several open source project with different licenses.  Please not that MKNetworkKit has a custom license by its creator that is listed in the files. Google's OAuth kit is licensed under the Apache v2 License.


## Purpose
- Our project is an iOS application called SMARTBOX.  With SMARTBOX, you can view, edit, share, and manage your files from a conveniant native app.
- We've also brought in innovative features like our Column View that lets you see where you are in your data hierarchy.
- Another exciting feature is our floating views.  These let you preview and move many files without taking up the whole screen.  Want to use the whole screen? Not a problem, the floating views can take over the whole screen on your command.
- SMARTBOX works with the OS's "Open in..." feature to allow you to move you SmartFile data to other apps on the device.  This also goes the other direction, once you have a file you want to move to SmartFile, just open it in SMARTBOX and you are on your way.

## Prerequisites

- The app will run on an iOS device with iOS 5 or higher.  It is designed to take advantage of the iPad's large screen, but works well on an iPhone
- To view the app in the simulator, you will need a Mac running OS X 10.7 or above
- You will need Xcode installed (available from the Mac App Store)

## Installation

- Download the .zip archive by clicking the link near the top of this page
- Unarchive it using your method of choice (probably just trying to open the downloaded folder)
- In the unarchived folder find and open "SMARTBOX.xcodeproj"
- Once you have opened the file, there will be a warning that should guide you through setting up the project for testing

## Running the App
- Once you have completed the installation steps, run the app by clicking the Run button in the upper left of the Xcode window

- The maintainers of this project are Eric Lovelace and Levi Miller. Contact us on github with questions or comments

## Collaboration
- This project was born out of a passion for the Open Source way of doing things.  We encourage anyone to develop improvements to our projects or use some of our code in their own.  Though by no means required, we would love to hear what you do with it so make a pull request or drop us a line if you would like.
